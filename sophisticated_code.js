/* sophisticated_code.js */

// This code demonstrates a complex and elaborate implementation of a simple web-based game called "Monster Arena".
// The game allows users to create and train their own virtual monsters, which can then be used to battle against other players' monsters.

// Define the Monster class
class Monster {
  constructor(name, type) {
    this.name = name;
    this.type = type;
    this.health = 100;
    this.attack = 10;
    this.defense = 5;
  }

  // Method to attack another monster
  attackMonster(target) {
    const damage = Math.floor(Math.random() * this.attack) + 1;
    target.health -= damage;
    console.log(`${this.name} attacked ${target.name} for ${damage} damage!`);
  }

  // Method to train the monster and increase its attributes
  train() {
    this.attack += 2;
    this.defense += 1;
    console.log(`${this.name} trained and improved its attack and defense!`);
  }
}

// Function to simulate a battle between two monsters
function simulateBattle(monster1, monster2) {
  console.log(`--- ${monster1.name} vs ${monster2.name} ---`);
  while (monster1.health > 0 && monster2.health > 0) {
    // Monster 1 attacks Monster 2
    monster1.attackMonster(monster2);
    if (monster2.health <= 0)
      break;

    // Monster 2 attacks Monster 1
    monster2.attackMonster(monster1);
  }

  // Determine the winner of the battle
  if (monster1.health <= 0 && monster2.health <= 0)
    console.log("It's a tie!");
  else if (monster1.health > 0)
    console.log(`${monster1.name} is the winner!`);
  else if (monster2.health > 0)
    console.log(`${monster2.name} is the winner!`);
}

// Create some monster instances
const monster1 = new Monster("Fire Dragon", "Fire");
const monster2 = new Monster("Water Serpent", "Water");

// Simulate a battle between the monsters
simulateBattle(monster1, monster2);

// Train the monsters
monster1.train();
monster2.train();

// Simulate another battle between the monsters after they have trained
simulateBattle(monster1, monster2);

// ... Repeat the above steps several more times for more complex gameplay ...

// End of the code
